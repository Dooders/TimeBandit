"""
The Branch class is designed to represent a branch of temporal states in the Time class

Effectively a branch is a specialized edge between a time in space??? Or a point in time that establishes a new stream of space?

Branches can break off into new branches and merge back together

Can be used to diverge from an existing parent branch to simulate a the effects 
of an altered space state knowing the results of the parent branch.

Pick a time in a simulation, branch off with a new branch to compare the results
vs the parent branch.

Can be used to simulate the effects of a new feature or a change in space state
on the simulation.

Store a reference to the parent time and the point of divergence.
Maintain its own stream of states independent of the parent after divergence.

add methods to visualize the branches and their connections
Implement mechanisms to merge branches back into the parent timeline if needed.
Consider concurrency issues if multiple branches are created and manipulated simultaneously.

Applications of Branching Functionality in Simulations
Alternate Histories:

Scenario Planning: Explore different outcomes based on varying initial conditions 
or events. This is useful in strategic planning, policy analysis, and forecasting.
What-If Analysis: Assess the impact of different decisions or actions at various 
points in time.

Further Enhancements
Visualization: Implement visualization tools to display the branches and their 
states, making it easier to analyze and compare different timelines.
Branch Merging: Develop methods to merge branches back into the main timeline or 
other branches, allowing for more complex scenario analyses.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the simulation performance to handle large-scale 
branching and state management efficiently.
Interactive Simulations: Create interactive simulations where users can manually 
create branches and explore different outcomes based on their inputs.

Branch ID: A unique identifier for the branch.
