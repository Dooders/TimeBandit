"""
A persistent, conditional, or temporal effect that influences an object during 
it's update step.

An effect is the result of an interaction in the simulation, like a 
force being applied to a ball in space, or a change in temperature in a room.

The interaction of force on the object incurs an effect on the object that 
continues based on the rules of the effect.

A ball in space would continue forever in the direction opposite the force
applied to it, given no other influences or interactions.
