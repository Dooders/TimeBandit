Module to design and manage the idea of update systems. 
Also need to define standards and rules for how to update objects.
Maybe update system is added to an object at init
Should update always return the state of the object?
Finalize a update process and sequence. Make it easy
But how do I manage all these components and systems that may have interdependencies?
