Temporal Relationship Object Graph System (TROGS) is a framework for modeling and analyzing evolving relationships between objects over time. TROGS captures and visualizes temporal states and interactions, providing a clear representation of how objects and their connections change across different time steps.

Threads: Temporal edges, edges between temporal states and not edges between objects in a specific state. 2 types, Self and Root

Relationships: edges between objects in a space. not between temporal states. Many types, highly customizable.

Interactions: edges between objects that have causul effects. Many types, highly customizable.
